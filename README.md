# IDN Punycode attack sample
A site to contain the demostration of homoglyph attacks on IDN using Punycode

This site, [www.cąixabank.com](https://www.cąixabank.com) looks like legit www.caixabank.com (a Spanish bank). It only differs in the `a` glyph. Legit site is `a`, whilst this fake site uses a very similar one: `ą`. Someone could think it's dirt in their screen and proceed to trust the site despite it's not the legit one.
